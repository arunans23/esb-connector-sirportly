Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB Sirportly connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-dev/esb-connectors/tree/master/integration-base 

Tested Platform: 

 - Mac OSx 10.9
 - WSO2 ESB 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT
 - Java 1.7

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download ESB 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT from official website. Extract the ESB and put "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh.

 2. Create a Sirportly trial account and derive the API Token and Secret.
   i)    Using the URL "https://sirportly.com/start" create a Sirportly trial account and note the subdomain used in the registration.
   ii)   Login to the created Sirportly account and go to https://{subdomain}.sirportly.com/admin/api_tokens and add a new Api token.Click the Edit button of the created Api Token and obtain the Token and Secret. 
  
 3. Follow the below mentioned steps to add valid certificate to access Sirportly API over https.

    i)   Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to 'https://{subdomain}.sirportly.com' 
    ii)  Go to new ESB 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT folder and place the downloaded certificate into "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and
         "<SIRPORTLY_CONNECTOR_HOME>src/test/resources/keystores/products" folders.
    iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute the following command.

                keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME"

         This command will import Sirportly certificate into keystore. 
         To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

         NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME - Replace CERT_FILE_NAME with the file name that was extracted from Sirportly with the extension. (e.g. sirportly.crt)
                CERT_NAME - Replace CERT_NAME with an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. sirportly)

    iv) Navigate to "<SIRPORTLY_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute the following command.

                keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" 

         This command will import Sirportly certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
         To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

         NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME - Replace CERT_FILE_NAME with the file name that was extracted from Sirportly with the extension. (e.g. sirportly.crt)
                CERT_NAME - Replace CERT_NAME with an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. sirportly).

 4. Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-4.9.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location "<SIRPORTLY_CONNECTOR_HOME>/repository/".
